Excel table is for understanding layout while printing 4x1 (4 pages on one paper sheet)

If you would like to add some song here - please feel free to make an issue and put all the information there - song, text, chords, url, whatever.

Unfortunately, due to the binary nature of Word file, I cannot accept PRs because of risk of losing data.

As an alternatiwe - anyone is welcome to continue LaTex from [feature/tex](tree/feature/tex) branch and make book diff-friendly.
